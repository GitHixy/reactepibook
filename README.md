# EpiBooks Project

EpiBooks is a dynamic web application built with React, utilizing Bootstrap for styling and Redux for state management. It showcases a collection of books fetched using Axios, offering users the ability to interact with book data. The project serves as a platform to implement, study, and learn Redux, Axios, and React Bootstrap, even within the scope of a small-scale application.

Search Functionality: A search bar in the navbar allows for filtering through the book array.
Interactive Book Details: Clicking on a book card reveals more details, including comments and ratings from other users, through a modal.
CRUD Operations: Users can add, edit, or delete comments and ratings using POST, PUT, and DELETE methods with Axios.
Persistence: All operations are saved in the backend endpoint, ensuring data continuity.
Theme Switching: A toggle for light and dark modes enhances user experience.

## Usage

Explore the book collection on the main page. Use the search functionality to filter results. Interact with books to view detailed information, comments, and ratings. Feel free to contribute your thoughts on a book or adjust the theme according to your preference.
